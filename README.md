### Description
This repository contains a breakdown of the various data structures and algorithms implemented in java

### Table of contents
* [Singly Linked Lists](#singlylinkedlists)
* [Doubly Linked Lists](#doublylinkedlists)

### SinglyLinkedLists
In this [section](https://github.com/Kondwani7/Data-structures-and-Algorithms-Java/blob/main/src/com/LinkedList/LinkedList.java), we covered these concepts such as:
* printing a singly linked list
* Getting the length of a singly linked list
* Insert a node at the beginning and end of a singly linked list
* insert a node at a given position of a linked list
* delete a node at the beginning end of a singly linked list
* delete a node at a given position of a linked list
* search for a specific value of a node in a linked list
* Reverse a linked list
* Find the middle node in a linked list
* fnd the nth node from the end of the linked list
### DoublyLinkedLists
In this [section](), we cover concepts such as:
* first
* second
